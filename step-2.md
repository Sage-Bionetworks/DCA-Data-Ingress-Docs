# Step 2 - Request a Metadata Template

At present, the DCC supports a web-based metadata upload via the [Data Curator web app](https://www.synapse.org/#!Wiki:syn20681266/ENTITY) in Synapse. You can generate a metadata template using the app -- note that the template will change depending on your data type. 

1. Navigate to the Data Ingress App and log in to Synapse if prompted
2. Go to "Select Yor Dataset" in the sidebar navigation of the app. 
3. Select your Project (if you have more than one) from the dropdown
4. Select your Folder from the droipdown. Dataset folders you have access to will be loaded automatically.
5. Select the template for your dataset. All RFC-defined data types are available.

For a detailed step-by-step on how to generate your metadata for the first time or for how to update existing metadata, please refer to the following pages:

[Go to Updating Existing Metadata Steps](update-existing-metadata){: .btn }

We are working on providing: 
   
   1. A Python package for programmatic metadata upload and management; 
   and 
   2. An API for programmatic metadata upload and management. 
   
   These will be available in the next release of the DCC data pipeline. Please check with your [DCC liaison](step-1) on details.
