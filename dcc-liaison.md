# Contact Your DCC Liaison

When you reach out to your DCC liaison, let them know the following:
- Your center
- Your datatype
- Your desired cloud storage (AWS, GCS)*
- Who on your team will be doing the data upload

Here's an email template that you can fill out and send:

```
Hello DCC Liaison,

We're ready to begin uploading <your datatype here> for <your center here>. We'd like to use <cloud storage type>. My team members that will be assisting in this process will be:
- <team member 1 name, team member 1 email>
- <team member 2 name, team member 2 email>
- <team member 3 name, team member 3 email>

<Your signature>
```

With the above information, the DCC will initialize your Synapse project and storage location. Once your Synapse project has been initialized, your DCC liaison will reach out to you with the location of your Synapse project and you can begin uploading your data using either the web or programmatic interface.
