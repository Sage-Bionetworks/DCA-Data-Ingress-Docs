# Contact Your DCC Liaison

Before uploading any data to Synapse, the very first step is to contact your DCC liaison. If you're not sure who your DCC liaison is, you can use the DCC Liaison table (below) to find them.

When you reach out to your DCC liaison, let them know the following:
- Your center
- [Your desired cloud storage (AWS, GCS)](choose-your-cloud-storage-platform)
- Who on your team will be doing the data upload

Here's an email template that you can fill out and send:

```
Hello DCC Liaison,
We're ready to begin uploading <your datatype here> for <your center here>. We'd like to use <cloud storage type>. My team members that will be assisting in this process will be:
- <team member 1 name, e-mail, Synapse username>
- <team member 2 name, e-mail, Synapse username>
- <team member 3 name, e-mail, Synapse username>

<Your signature>
```

With the above information, the DCC will initialize your Synapse project and storage location. Once your Synapse project has been initialized, your DCC liaison will reach out to you with the location of your Synapse project and you can begin uploading your data.
